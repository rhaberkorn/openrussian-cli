# An Offline Console Russian Dictionary (based on openrussian.org)

This is an offline console and terminal-friendly Russian dictionary,
based on the database of [openrussian.org](https://en.openrussian.org/).

* Works offline (without internet access) and is very fast.
  This really pays off if you browse Russian words a lot.
* It integrates well into the console environment - browse dictionary
  entries like man pages.
  Internally, Troff code is generated which makes further processing of generated
  pages ~~very easy~~ possible.
* Puts very low requirements on the runtime environment:
  a black and white terminal display is sufficient.
* Auto completions supported for Bash and Zsh.
  Most of this is handled by the script's `-C` argument, so it
  is trivial to add support for other shells.
  Contributions are welcome!
* Search terms can be: base forms (infinitives, nominative singular nouns...),
  inflections (all cases, conjugations, short forms, imperatives...) and
  translations.
* Search terms are [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)),
  which is very useful for looking up words with uncertain spelling or finding
  related words.

Possible future features:

* Limit the number of results (by default to 1000) - the sheer number of results
  can slow down auto-completions.
* Not all terminals can display the accent correctly (linux console), so we should have
  a fallback.
  Ideally this can be detected, or we simply whitelist terminal emulators via $TERM.
* Better internationalization when generating German pages (`-Lde`).
* Lookups via popular
  [ASCII-cyrillic transliterations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_romanizations_of_Cyrillic) -
  would be useful without a Russian/cyrillic keyboard layout.
* Be tolerant to typing mistakes.
* Accented characters are still broken in nroff tables
  (see https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/groff/2018-08/msg00000.html).
  We could and probably should of translate most vowel-accent combinations to single precomposed codepoints,
  but that might cause problems when copying text from the terminal.

## Installation

### Ubuntu

Build-time dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install make pkg-config lua5.2 bash-completion wget unzip gawk sqlite3

Run-time dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install lua5.2 lua-sql-sqlite3 man-db bash-completion

Furthermore, you will need the [luautf8 library](https://github.com/starwing/luautf8).
Using [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/), it may be installed as follows:

    sudo luarocks-5.2 install luautf8

Building is straight forward:

    make
    sudo make install

If you want to redownload the latest [openrussian.org](https://en.openrussian.org/)
database:

    make clean all check

**Warning:** While the database content might be newer, the database schema
might also at any time become incompatible with the existing script.
That is why a `check` is performed after building everything in the above
example.
If it returns lots of errors, you should probably stay with the original database.
Otherwise, the error messages might help in fixing/upgrading the script.
You are of course welcome to contribute patches. :-)

### FreeBSD

Build-time dependencies:

    pkg install gmake pkgconf groff lua52 lua52-luasql-sqlite3 lua52-luarocks wget sqlite3

Installing [luautf8](https://github.com/starwing/luautf8) using LuaRocks:

    luarocks52 install luautf8

Building is straight forward:

    gmake LUA=lua52 LUAC=luac52
    gmake install

### NixOS

`openrussian-cli` is part of the `nixos-unstable` (and soon `nixos-21.05`) channels.

To install `openrussian-cli` on NixOS:
* Via `configuration.nix`:
  ```nix
  environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.openrussian-cli ];
  ```
* Via `nix-env`:
  ```bash
  nix-env -iA openrussian-cli
  ```

See https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-package-management for more information.

### Bash Aliases

While the default command name `openrussian` was chosen to avoid cluttering the
global command namespace, you may want to define more concise shortcuts.
In order to do so, add something like the following to your `~/.bashrc`:

    alias ru='openrussian' ру='openrussian'
    _completion_loader openrussian
    complete -F _openrussian_completions ru ру

This adds the alias `ru` (latin) and `ру` (cyrillic).
It would however be useful to add a few default options to the `ru` and `ру` aliases.
Unfortunately, above method cannot take that into account.
A more robust solution might be to install the
[complete-alias](https://github.com/cykerway/complete-alias) script and adding
something like the following to your `~/.bash_completion`:

    alias ru='openrussian -Lde -Len' ру='openrussian -Lde -Len'
    complete -F _complete_alias ru ру

### Zsh Aliases

Autocompletion will automatically work with aliases in the Zsh, so it is
sufficient to add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:

    alias ru='openrussian -Lde -Len' ру='openrussian -Lde -Len'

### Fish Aliases

The Fish `alias` command creates local shell aliases or
persistent aliases when invoked with the `--save` flag.

    alias --save ru='openrussian -Lde -Len'
    alias --save ру='openrussian -Lde -Len'

## Examples

A simple lookup:

    openrussian саморазрушение

Display the German translation:

    openrussian -Lde саморазрушение

Display both German and English translations, giving precedence to German:

    openrussian -Lde -Len саморазрушение

If you are unsure which consonants appear in this word:

    openrussian самора[сз]ру[шщ]ение

Find more words derived from "разрушение":

    openrussian *разрушение

Avoid ambiguous search results:

    openrussian -V коса

Look up by translation:

    openrussian catch a cold

Graphical display using `groffer`:

    openrussian -p кошка | groffer -Kutf8 --mode pdf2

You may have to specify a non-default font supporting
cyrillic characters via groffer's `-f` option.
